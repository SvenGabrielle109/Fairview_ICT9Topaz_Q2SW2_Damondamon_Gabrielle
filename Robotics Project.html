				<p>The remote control aspect is critical to this solution, as it provides farmers with the ability to oversee and direct the robot’s movements in real-time. The 5-meter range allows operators to maintain a safe distance from potential pesticide exposure while still ensuring close supervision. The integration of sensors, cameras, and advanced algorithms enables the robot to identify crops and distinguish them from weeds, ensuring accurate pesticide application only where necessary. This not only optimizes pesticide usage but also reduces the environmental impact associated with excessive chemical dispersal.</p>
