			<td>
				<p>The remote control aspect is critical to this solution, as it provides farmers with the ability to oversee and direct the robot’s movements in real-time. The 5-meter range allows operators to maintain a safe distance from potential pesticide exposure while still ensuring close supervision. The integration of sensors, cameras, and advanced algorithms enables the robot to identify crops and distinguish them from weeds, ensuring accurate pesticide application only where necessary. This not only optimizes pesticide usage but also reduces the environmental impact associated with excessive chemical dispersal.</p>

			<td>Smart Shopping Trolley that Follows the Customer</td>
			<td><img src="SST.jpeg"></td>
			<td>
				<p>Smart human following shopping trolleys are designed to follow customers automatically, eliminating the need for them to push the cart manually. This technology offers convenience and ease for shoppers, allowing them to focus on shopping and enjoying their experience. The smart trolley is equipped with various sensors and cameras that can detect the customer’s location and follow them while they shop.
One of the primary advantages of smart human following shopping trolleys is that they provide a more personalized shopping experience. Shoppers can easily navigate through the store without the need to push their trolley or worry about losing it. They can focus on the products they want to purchase and spend more time browsing without any hassle.</p>

			<td>Object Tracker & Follower Robot Using Raspberry Pi</td>
			<td><img src="OT+FB.jpeg"></td>
			<td>
				<p>One of the aspect of tracking an object from its visuals has been taken up in this project Object Tracker and Follower Robot. In essence this project clubs in image processing and driving a robot autonomously with what visuals have been caught as has been in the case of Machine Vision projects. This project will be using a Raspberry Pi processor board for computational purpose and driving of the robot. The camera attached to the system captures the images of the front of the robot where it is attached. By monitoring a stream of incoming images the robot is able to autonomously decide to proceed in which direction it should go. The incoming visuals are processed using image processing techniques.</p>

			<td>Rough Terrian Beetle Robot</td>
			<td><img src="RTBR.jpeg"></td>
			<td>
				<p> Its small size allows it to get go through rough terrains like a small animal crawling through the jungle with very little noise. The robot uses a crawling mechanism to achieve this task. The robot uses a microcontroller based circuit to control the motors and achieve desired movement. The robotic vehicle uses specialized climbers to climb and descend on hilly terrains. The climbers also allow it to crawl easily through bushes and grass. Also it allows the robot to cross rocky paths and obstacles. The robot is remotely controlled by a joystick remote. This allows the user to remotely control the directional movement as well as speed and power of the robot.</p>

			<td>Smart Solar Grass Cutter With Lawn Coverage</td>
			<td><img src="SSGC.jpeg"></td>
			<td>
				<p>The robotic vehicle is equipped with a grass cutter blade that allows for grass cutting at high RPM. The system has a smart functionality that allows it to cover the complete area of a lawn or garden by detecting corners using ultrasonic sensor and moving in a zigzag manner in order to cover the entire area. This efficient system uses a microcontroller based circuit in order to achieve this functionality. It is a battery operated system that uses 2 batteries. One battery is used to run the vehicle movement DC motors and the other one is used to power the grass cutter motor. Also the system uses a solar panel to demonstrate the charging of vehicle movement battery.</p>
